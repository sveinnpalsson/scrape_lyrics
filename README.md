### Scrape lyrics from a website to create a song lyric dataset

This is a very simple scrapy project that visits metrolyrics.com and downloads all the lyrics and saves them to a text file containing the artist name, song name and lyrics.
The dataset could then be used for some fun projects.

#### To use this project:
1. [Install scrapy](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html) e.g. by doing `conda install -c conda-forge scrapy`
2. In the root directory of this repo do `scrapy crawl lyrics`
3. Have fun with the dataset
